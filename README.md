# helloWorld
My very first HTML project
A follow along of David Gray's Beginner HTML series on YT
Personalized index.html and about.html is all me using what I learned from index.html
This will serve as a reference project for future projects
I am learning a ton, David is an excellent teacher with a good blend of depth and simple/easy to understand
(formatting, links, block vs inline, elements, super basic taste of CSS, etc)
Wish I was better at comments to leave a roadman of certain things for quick reference
Will update this as/if needed while continuing the playlist
When finished with list will stop updating but keep for looking back at my progress
Very excited for when I look back and say, "Wow, I have come a long way this was terrible lol"
